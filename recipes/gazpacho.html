            <h2>Easiest way to prepare spanish Gazpacho</h2>
              <p>More of a drink than a soup, served in frosted glasses or chilled tumblers, gazpacho is perfect when it is too hot to eat but you need cold, salt and lunch all at the same time.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                  <ul>
                      <li>About 2 pounds ripe red tomatoes, cored and roughly cut into chunks</li>
                      <li>Italian frying (cubanelle) pepper or another long, light green pepper, such as Anaheim, cored, seeded and roughly cut into chunks</li>
                      <li>cucumber, about 8 inches long, peeled and roughly cut into chunks</li>
                      <li>small mild onion (white or red), peeled and roughly cut into chunks</li>
                      <li>clove garlic</li>
                      <li>teaspoons sherry vinegar, more to taste</li>
                      <li>Salt</li>
                      <li>Â½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, more to taste, plus more for drizzling</li>
                  </ul>
                <h3> Steps </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine tomatoes, pepper, cucumber, onion and garlic in a blender or, if using a hand blender, in a deep bowl. (If necessary, work in batches.) Blend at high speed until very smooth, at least 2 minutes, pausing occasionally to scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula.</li>
                    <li>With the motor running, add the vinegar and 2 teaspoons salt. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil. The mixture will turn bright orange or dark pink and become smooth and emulsified, like a salad dressing. If it still seems watery, drizzle in more olive oil until texture is creamy.</li>
                    <li>Strain the mixture through a strainer or a food mill, pushing all the liquid through with a spatula or the back of a ladle. Discard the solids. Transfer to a large pitcher (preferably glass) and chill until very cold, at least 6 hours or overnight.</li>
                    <li>Before serving, adjust the seasonings with salt and vinegar. If soup is very thick, stir in a few tablespoons ice water. Serve in glasses, over ice if desired, or in a bowl. A few drops of olive oil on top are a nice touch.</li>
                </ol>
